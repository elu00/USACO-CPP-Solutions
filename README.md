# USACO-CPP-Solutions
## About
This repo is a collection of solutions in C++11 to the problems in the official [USACO training program](http://train.usaco.org/usacogate) as well as in official USACO Contests.

All solutions were written and debugged with Visual Studio 2015, but should be completely compatible with GNU GCC (used by the grader in these contests).

For original problem statements, test/sample data, as well as actual grading capabilites, please see the [USACO training program website](http://train.usaco.org/usacogate) or the [previous contests page](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=contests)

I really hope you find this repo helpful; feel free to submit a PR, open an issue, or message me if you have any changes, suggestions, or comments you'd like to make!
## Updates
I'll be updating the solutions to the training problems as I work through it section by section. Hopefully, my goal is to have solutions through Chapter 5 prior to my graduation.

Solutions to contest problems will be updated similiarily; I'll be updating these as I complete contests with my personal notes, within whichever tier I'm in. Of course, these updates will not occur until after official results have been posted on the USACO website.

Hope you find this repo useful!
